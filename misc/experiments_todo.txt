Experiments/Lab Work To Do

Check Motor Control Circuit
    Goal:
        Find out why the speed circuit only varies between ~5.1v and ~8v
        Discover more information about how the circuit is working IRL
    Procedure:
        Find actual relation between resistance of pot and potval (should be 0-10kR for 0-127 val)

Calibration of motor (1):
    Goal:
        Obtain Speed/volt curve
    Procedure:
        Set voltage to minimum
        Increment voltage (dig_pot signal + 1)
        Wait 1s
        Record speed
        Record voltage
        Draw graph of pot value (0-127) vs recorded speed
        Repeat x3
        Fit eqn to graph(s)

Calibration of motor (2):
    Goal:
        Torques (stall torque, free torque, torque/voltage) Torque => Stress
    Procedure:
        Run motor with no load, record input power, record rotational speed
        Calculate power input to the motor: Power (W) = Current (A) * Voltage (V)
        (There will be some efficiency term required)
        Calculate Free Torque: Power(W) = Torque (Nm) * Rotational Speed (rad/s) [or W = Nm * (2Pi/60) * RPM]
        Repeat at various voltages (dig pot values 0 to 127, step 8?)
        Draw graph, fit line
        eqn of line ~= T(V)
        Calculate motor's efficiency
        Compare efficiency calculated with datasheet
        Use to calculate the Stress imposed per volt

Calibration of motor (3):
    Goal:
        Motor control model, controller tuning
    Procedure:
        set motor speed to middle (pot val ~64)
        Every 0.1s throughout, record time (from 0) and motor speed
        wait 5s
        increase motor speed (pot val ~96)
        wait 5s
        draw graph of response (speed vs time)
        fit a FOPDT model to the response
        
        Options:
            (1) implement model in simulink
                use simulink's autotune to tune the control parameters, deciding upon the optimal solution
            (2) use bespoke autotune script
        
        
System check:
    Goal:
        Check if RPi control system works well
    Procedure:
        Use Rpi to examine rheology of reference fluids (glycerol/water/mix) (record viscosity)
        Shear stress = shear viscosity * shear rate (t = mu * dU/dY)
        Use rheometer to examine rheology
        Compare resulting data
